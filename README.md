this is pretty much the clock script as it existed on my hosting.
in this form it is not responsive, the digits wrap to the next line, ruining the clocky standard appearance.  the digits need to be wrapped in an element and sized with percentages that take into account their proportions. the wrapper element can then scale with the window while the clock keeps its shape.
