so what are the next steps?

test the new inline svgs on mobile devices, multiple browsers

add a color picker (farbtastic?) so user can change digit/background color
  a radio selector for which color will be changed? value queried in callback
  for color picker? toggle visibility of color picker?  how to keep the design of the site sharp?
